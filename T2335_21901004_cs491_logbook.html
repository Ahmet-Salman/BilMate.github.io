            I began working on my assigned UML diagram which was the Object Diagram
			<br>
			I also created the boilerplate for the Analysis report

            I had stumbled when it came to retreiving a single posting from the MongoDB document. There were
			2 solutions, the first is retreiving the entire document, then simply comparing everything in a for loop.
			The second solution was to use the aggregate function of MongoDB.
			In terms of response time, both were very similar with the for loop approach being slightly faster
			However, the aggregate approach saves alot of network bandwidth, so because our application is a 
			Mobile application, i have decided to go with the aggregate approach
			<br>
			I finished the Object diagram and planning to arrange a meeting to discuss possible improvements
            <br>

            The backend team held a meeting to discuss the Object diagram as
			the design of the backend should not be left to a single person
			We decided to improve the design by removing the "stayDuration" field 
			from the user preference and add "startDate" and "endDate" as fields for
			a posting, this will give the user more flexibility and allow them
			to plan ahead 
			<br>
			After the meeting, I went to modify the Object diagram to reflect our design choices better

            I started implementation from about the 4th week 
			and started writing the basic endpoints such as
			creating/getting/updating/deleting a user and the
			same CRUD operations for postings, however i am working with
			a subset of the full fields for incremental progress

            The first big challenge about our matching algorithm has arrived,
			how can we retrieve potentially 100s of postings and sort them in order
			of decreasing matching based on user preference while maintaining fast 
			response time.
			I need to think about it for a good amount of time
