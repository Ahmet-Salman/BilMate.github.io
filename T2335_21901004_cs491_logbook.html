            I began working on my assigned UML diagram which was the Object Diagram

            I had stumbled when it came to retreiving a single posting from the MongoDB document. There were
			2 solutions, the first is retreiving the entire document, then simply comparing everything in a for loop.
			The second solution was to use the aggregate function of MongoDB.
			In terms of response time, both were very similar with the for loop approach being slightly faster
			However, the aggregate approach saves alot of network bandwidth, so because our application is a 
			Mobile application, i have decided to go with the aggregate approach
			<br>
			I finished the Object diagram and planning to arrange a meeting to discuss possible improvements
            <br>

            The backend team held a meeting to discuss the Object diagram as
			the design of the backend should not be left to a single person
			We decided to improve the design by removing the "stayDuration" field 
			from the user preference and add "startDate" and "endDate" as fields for
			a posting, this will give the user more flexibility and allow them
			to plan ahead 
			<br>
			After the meeting, I went to modify the Object diagram to reflect our design choices better

            I started implementation from about the 4th week 
			and started writing the basic endpoints such as
			creating/getting/updating/deleting a user and the
			same CRUD operations for postings, however i am working with
			a subset of the full fields for incremental progress

            The first big challenge about our matching algorithm has arrived,
			how can we retrieve potentially 100s of postings and sort them in order
			of decreasing matching based on user preference while maintaining fast 
			response time.
			I need to think about it for a good amount of time

            I have some worries that the performance of the query would be sub-par,
			In response, I started exploring indexes for the query, the most logical
			field to begin with was the "id" field for the users as we always search for
			IDs of users.
			<br>
			Another problem is that we cannot get realistic performance, at least at this stage of development
			so we have to pray and hope for the best for the time being

            During the past 2 weeks of development, I only dealt with partial data. What I mean is that if the 
			user should've had name, surname, phone, and email, I only tested the initial queries with a subset of these.
			Today i decided to remove that constraint for the user, so the functions now deal with the user as
			we expect it to look like in the actual program, and naturally, some problems occured. But it is
			nothing that cannot be solved

            For the past several days, I implemented the changes in the design document into the code
			I also extended the models of postings and users, so now the functionalities are fully integrated.
			I will carry out another review of the Object diagram to ensure that it reflects what our system should look like

            I haven't worked much on BilMate for this week due to midterms, however that 
			gave me the chance to start thinking about the email verification and the

            The midterms have finally come to an end, this allowed
			me to get back to working on BilMate. This week gave me some time
			to think about the little details when building the backend.
			For beginers, I have decided to separate the endpoints for 
			the 'House Sharer' and 'House Seeker' posts because they have
			quite different models and may grow even more distinct as we
			progress in the project. So today I have committed these changes
			and did some reformmating for better software engineering practices :)))

            It's been quite a while, welcome back my dear readers.
			Throughout the past month, we progressed quite a bit.
			For beginners, I finished the macthing algorithm and deployed it 
			on the backend.
			
			We also spoke to AWS and negotiated a sponsorship deal so they 
			cover the costs of the backend server until the end of the year in
			return for including that our application is powered by AWS.
			Aside from that, we added images to posts and began the final touches
			on the reporting system and the admin panel.
			
			I believe we are set on track for a successful launch of our application
			towards mid april.
