            I began working on my assigned UML diagram which was the Object Diagram
			<br>
			I also created the boilerplate for the Analysis report

            I had stumbled when it came to retreiving a single posting from the MongoDB document. There were
			2 solutions, the first is retreiving the entire document, then simply comparing everything in a for loop.
			The second solution was to use the aggregate function of MongoDB.
			In terms of response time, both were very similar with the for loop approach being slightly faster
			However, the aggregate approach saves alot of network bandwidth, so because our application is a 
			Mobile application, i have decided to go with the aggregate approach
			<br>
			I finished the Object diagram and planning to arrange a meeting to discuss possible improvements
            <br>

            The backend team held a meeting to discuss the Object diagram as
			the design of the backend should not be left to a single person
			We decided to improve the design by removing the "stayDuration" field 
			from the user preference and add "startDate" and "endDate" as fields for
			a posting, this will give the user more flexibility and allow them
			to plan ahead 
			<br>
			After the meeting, I went to modify the Object diagram to reflect our design choices better

            I started implementation from about the 4th week 
			and started writing the basic endpoints such as
			creating/getting/updating/deleting a user and the
			same CRUD operations for postings, however i am working with
			a subset of the full fields for incremental progress

            The first big challenge about our matching algorithm has arrived,
			how can we retrieve potentially 100s of postings and sort them in order
			of decreasing matching based on user preference while maintaining fast 
			response time.
			I need to think about it for a good amount of time

            I have some worries that the performance of the query would be sub-par,
			In response, I started exploring indexes for the query, the most logical
			field to begin with was the "id" field for the users as we always search for
			IDs of users.
			<br>
			Another problem is that we cannot get realistic performance, at least at this stage of development
			so we have to pray and hope for the best for the time being

            During the past 2 weeks of development, I only dealt with partial data. What I mean is that if the 
			user should've had name, surname, phone, and email, I only tested the initial queries with a subset of these.
			Today i decided to remove that constraint for the user, so the functions now deal with the user as
			we expect it to look like in the actual program, and naturally, some problems occured. But it is
			nothing that cannot be solved

            For the past several days, I implemented the changes in the design document into the code
			I also extended the models of postings and users, so now the functionalities are fully integrated.
			I will carry out another review of the Object diagram to ensure that it reflects what our system should look like

            I haven't worked much on BilMate for this week due to midterms, however that 
			gave me the chance to start thinking about the email verification and the
			flow of the user actions. I started implementing email verification, but I 
			still need to consider some edge cases and ensure that the email is recieved
			properly

            I have completely finished the email verification for the user signup along

			Amazon SES to deal with the email sending
			I also created an instructions file to run the backend server
