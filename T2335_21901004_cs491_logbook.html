            I had stumbled when it came to retreiving a single posting from the MongoDB document. There were
			2 solutions, the first is retreiving the entire document, then simply comparing everything in a for loop.
			The second solution was to use the aggregate function of MongoDB.
			In terms of response time, both were very similar with the for loop approahc being slightly faster
			However, the aggregate approach saves alot of network bandwidth, so because our application is a 
			Mobile application, i have decided to go with the aggregate approach
			<br>
			I created the state diagrams for "house-sharer posting" and "house-seeker posting"
